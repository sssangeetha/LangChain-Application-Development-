# LangChain-Application-Development-
I used LangChain to build a RAG-based application where the LLM retrieves relevant knowledge from a vector store and combines it with real-time data from APIs to produce accurate answers. LangChain handled memory, document retrieval, and chain orchestration.


UI (React, TypeScript)

Backend (Node, Python, LangChain integrated here)

Vector DB (Pinecone, Chroma, FAISS)

Model (Gemini, OpenAI, Llama3, Local models)

Deployment + Monitoring
